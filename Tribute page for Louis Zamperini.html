            <p style="font-size:150%;font-family: Arial;">Zamperini competed in the 1936 Berlin Olympics and was set to compete again in the 1940 games in Tokyo, which were canceled when World War II broke out.
            In 1941, he was commissioned into the United States Army Air Forces as a lieutenant. On a search and rescue mission, Zamperini's plane experienced mechanical difficulties and crashed into the ocean, and after drifting at sea on a lifeboat for 47 days, with two other crewmates, he landed on the Japanese occupied Marshall Islands where he was taken as a prisoner of war and tortured for two years.
            He was taken to two different prisoner-of-war camps in Japan where he was tortured and beaten by Japanese military personnel,specifically by Mutsuhiro Watanabe-also known as "the Bird". 
            Zamperini was released only after the war ended in 1945, and he returned to the United States.
